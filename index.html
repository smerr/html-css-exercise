              <p>Cmder is a software package created out of pure frustration over the absence of nice console emulators on Windows. It is based on amazing software, and spiced up with the Monokai color scheme and a custom prompt layout, looking sexy from the start. </p>

                <h3>With help of the best</h3>
                <p>Think about cmder more as a software package than a separate app. All the magic is happening through <a href="https://conemu.github.io/">ConEmu</a>. With enhancements from <a href="https://mridgers.github.io/clink/">Clink</a>.</p>

                <h3>Total portability</h3>
                <p>Carry it with you on a USB stick or in the Cloud, so your settings, aliases and history can go anywhere you go. You will not see that ugly Windows prompt ever again.</p>

                <h3>Git and others</h3>
                <p>Oooh yes! If you decide to use the slightly bigger git-for-windows version, you will have all Unix commands ready in PATH so that you can <code>git init</code> or <code>cat</code> instantly on every machine.</p>

        <h2>Notes / Docs</h2>

        <h3>Aliases</h3>
        <p>There is simple support for aliases. They can be created by using the alias command like this: alias ls=ls --color $*. They are pretty much just doskeys in /config/aliases. One per line. And make sure to handle arguments by putting argument variables $* somewhere.</p>

        <h3>Updating + Building</h3>
        <p>There is not much going on here. But if you want to get most recent updates for Conemu just tick auto-updating in preferences. If you want to clone the repo and build it yourself, you will need PowerShell >=3.0 and 7z. When you are set on that, just run scripts/build.ps1.</p>

        <h3>Documentations</h3>
